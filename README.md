# Project Overview

In this project i was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I had to write unit tests for the same.

### Steps

1. Clone this project using git: ```git clone https://github.com/CryptopurrColumbus/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git```
2. Go to the project: ```cd frontend-nanodegree-feedreader```
3. Run a server to serve the files: ```python3 -m http.server```. This opens a web server at ```localhost:8000```
4. The tests run in your browser.
